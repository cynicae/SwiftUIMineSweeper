This is a version of MineSweeper written entirely in SwiftUI!

The code is not perfect, so feel free to fork and add your own twist to it! I'd love to see what you can come up with!

So far the project contains: 
- a level choosing screen
- a losing screen
- sounds for clicks on bombs and non-bomb squares


Future plans: 
- winning screen
- different number of bombs for each level

Enjoy! :)

Here is a sneak peak!
